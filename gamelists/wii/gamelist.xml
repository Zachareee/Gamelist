		<desc>Wii Sports Resort for Wii is a new version of the game traditionally sold with the console. A series of new challenges await you, some of them using the WiiMotion Plus, offering more precision for the controller's movements. The setting this time is a paradise island, where you can try your hand at jet-skiing, fencing or even throwing a freesbee so that your virtual dog catches it and brings it back to you.</desc>

		<name>Final Fantasy : 20th Anniversary Edition</name>
		<desc>Back in 1987, Hironobu Sakaguchi's Final Fantasy was supposed to be the last game in the Fantasy role-playing game series. However, destiny had other plans for Hironobu Sakaguchi and his creation. After twenty years and more than a dozen of canonical games the Final Fantasy franchise is still going strong and reaping the rewards of the original IP.

The original Final Fantasy game has already been re-released many times. The PSP version has been built upon the Game Boy Advance version of the game. It has bonus dungeons from the Gameboy/Wonderswan versions of the game but also features new improved graphics, all in 16:9 with easy to read big texts and better quality of music and general sounds. The CG intro from the PlayStation/Wonderswan version has also been redone in 16:9.

There is an entirely new dungeon dubbed "The Labyrinth of Time" which enforces a time limit within which you can explore its dark depths, and also another bonus: an unlockable Yoshitaka Amano Art Gallery which contains beautiful artwork from the artist who has provided the illustrations for many games in the series, and like in the GBA version there is also bestiary and a unlockable BGM music player. Other features do not change the GBA version much, even the the difficulty is the same as in Dawn of Souls.</desc>

		<name>Locoroco Midnight Carnival</name>
		<desc>LocoRoco Midnight Carnival is based on a secret carnival-like base, created by the BuiBui, a red, mischievous version of the MuiMui. The title shows that the LocoRoco were quietly sleeping, while in the background, a BuiBui pulls on a nearby lever (cleverly designed to just look like a star), opening a trapdoor under the LocoRoco, sending them into a chute, taking them into a cannon, which shows the LocoRoco "Boing!" power. The cannon sends the LocoRoco into the BuiBui's secret base, the midnight carnival.</desc>

		<name>Mega Man : Powered Up</name>
		<desc>Dr. Light had an idea: He would build a bunch of good and handy robots to help him and others to make the world a better place. One of these robots is named "Mega" and is designed to help Light around the lab in various tasks. One day, evil Dr. Wily attacks the lab and turn all of the robots evil too. All except Mega. Dr. Light sends Mega to stop these robots and thus, Mega Man is born.

Mega Man: Powered Up is a semi-remake of the original Mega Man.
There is an "Old Mode", where one tackles the adventure just like it was in the olden days, with the exception of an added feature to save game. The graphics are souped up, but the level layout is basically the same than in the original with a few minor changes here and there.
Then there's the "New Mode" which also features the original level themes and bosses but the levels themselves are boosted with various hidden areas and features which are mostly impossible to get to with Megaman only. The Player must defeat the bosses after which they'll be available as playable characters and use their special abilities to find everything in every level.

The third mode is the Challenge Mode where there is 100 different challenges to tackle and in which one has to dispatch as many enemies as possible in a given amount of time, get to the specific goal in a given amount of time and so on.

In addition to these two main game modes, there is a level editor that can be used to build the Megaman level of one's dreams and play it or send it to the internet where other gamers can download and play it.</desc>

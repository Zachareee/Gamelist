		<name>Crazy Kong</name>
		<desc>Is an arcade game developed by Falcon, released in 1981 and is similar to Nintendo's Donkey Kong. Although commonly believed to be a bootleg version, the game was officially licensed for operation only in Japan when Nintendo couldn't keep up with demand at home (even though Donkey Kong was still released there),[1] and is based on different hardware. The game retains all of the gameplay elements of Donkey Kong, but has all of the graphics redrawn and re-colorized. It is also known with four names: Congorilla, Big Kong, Donkey King, and Monkey Donkey.</desc>

It is your job to get little Mario to the top. For it is there, and only there, that he can send the mighty Donkey Kong to hit mortal doom. Leaving little Mario and the beautiful girl to live happily ever after. "SIGH. SIGH.‚Äù

		<desc>LittleBigPlanet is a puzzle platformer where the player controls sackboys. It takes the characters on an adventure through levels with different themes and settings, trying to reach the end of each level alive. The platforming is based entirely on physics where the sackboys can push or pull items, or generally manipulate them with their movement or weight. In addition to running, jumping, pushing and pulling, it is also necessary to master grabbing dangling objects and swinging from them to get over some obstacles and traps.</desc>

		<desc>LittleBigPlanet 3 is the third main game in the puzzle-platformer series and created by a different developer than the previous two. The game has an overarching story for the first time, with voiced supporting characters and cut-scene sequences, and it is set in Bunkum where the familiar Sackboy character meets Newton. He tricks Sackboy into unleashing three Titans, creatures that were locked up because they robbed the world of creativity.</desc>
